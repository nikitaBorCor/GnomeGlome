# GnomeGlome

This project was made to be submitted to the math communcation compeition, SoME1. Please read the article *GnomeGlomeArticle* to learn about the math behind this submission. You can download the MatLab file *gnomFiberPlot.m* to play around with the gnomonically projected circles discussed in the article. 

**Bugs:** Upon running the code you may not see anything graphed. Wiggle the figure around by clicking and holding on it while moving your mouse around. This should make the graph appear.
